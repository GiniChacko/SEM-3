 Q1. Explain  advantages and disadvantages of Inheritance.
 
	1.]The main advantages of inheritance are code reusability and readability.
	2.]When child class inherits the properties and functionality of parent class, 
	   we need not write the same code again in child class.
	3.]This makes it easier to reuse the code, makes us write the less code and the 
	   code becomes much more readable.
	
	4.]The main disadvantage of using inheritance is that the two classes 
	   (base and inherited class) get tightly coupled.
	5.]This means one cannot be used independently of each other.
	6.]Also with time, during maintenance adding new features both base as well as
	   derived classes are required to be changed.

Q2. Explain concept of  Static Binding and Dynamic Binding with respect to above example.

    Static Binding :
    
	1.]The binding which can be resolved at compile time by compiler is known as static or early binding. 
	   The binding of static, private and final methods is compile-time.
	2.]The reason is that the these method cannot be overridden and the type of the class is determined 
	   at the compile time. 
	3.]For the above example, BankAccount class is the superclass and all other classes are its subclasses.
	   Suppose we create an object of the subclass with reference to superclass.
	   Eg. 
	   
	   BankAccount a = new SavingsAccount();
	   
	   Here if any static method of subclass SavingsAccount is invoked with object a and if same static
	   method is present in superclass then compiler will invoke method of superclass because it knows
	   that method of superclass is static and can't be overridden in subclasses.
	   
	Dynamic Binding :
	   
	1.]When compiler is not able to resolve the call/binding at compile time, such binding is known as 
	   Dynamic or late Binding. Method Overriding is a perfect example of dynamic binding as in overriding 
	   both parent and child classes have same method and in this case the type of the object determines
	   which method is to be executed. 
	2.]Consider the same example as considered in static binding. If we invoke any method of subclass and
	   it is not static and also if same method is present in superclass and it is not static then method
	   of subclass will be invoked. Here, compiler goes by referencing variable and not y type of object.
	   Therefore, the binding would be delayed to runtime.	   
		   
		   
CONCLUSION : The concept of inheritance and it's use, the concept of static and dynamic binding was 
             understood by this bank application project.
             All the methods were tested successfully and understood.
