2. What happens when you start the thread 2 times?

Ans : 	A thread can't be started twice. Once a thread is started, it can never be started again.
		If you do so, an IllegalThreadStateException is thrown. 
		In such case, thread will run once but for second time, it will throw exception.

CONCLUSION : Implementing multithreaded Java code is reasonably straightforward. 
             Even converting existing single-threaded Java GUI code to a multithreaded format is not 
             difficult. Here bank operations, sign checker, sorting operations and stack operations
             were successfully experimented, understood and tested.
