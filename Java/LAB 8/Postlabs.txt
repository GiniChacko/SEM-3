 Q.1] Explain Top 10 Exceptions in java programming.
 
 Ans : 
 
 	1.]ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
       It is the child class of RuntimeException and hence it is an unchecked Exception. It is raised 
       automatically by the JVM whenever we are trying to access the array element with out of range index.
       
    2.]NullPointerException
       It is the child class of RuntimeException and hence it is an unchecked Exception.
       It is raised automatically by the JVM, whenever we are trying to perform any operation on null.
    
    3.]StackOverflowError
       It is the child class of VirtualMachineError, hence it is unchecked and it is raised by the JVM.
       It will raise whenever we are trying to perform recursive method invocation.
    
    4.]NoClassDefFoundError
       It is the child class of LinkageError , hence it is unchecked and raised automatically by the JVM. 
       Whenever the JVM unable to locate the required classes in the class path. Then it will raise this
       NoClassDefFoundError.
    
    5.]ClassCastException
       It is the child class of RuntimeException and hence it is an unchecked Exception. It is raised
       automatically by the JVM, whenever we are trying to type cast parent object to child type.
    
    6.]ExceptionInInitializerError
       It is the child class of LinkageError , hence it is unchecked and raised automatically by the JVM. 
       If any exception raised while performing initialization for static variables and while executing 
       static blocks, the JVM throws this error.
    
    7.]IllegalArgumentException
      It is the child class of RuntimeException and hence it is an unchecked Exception. It is raised 
      automatically by the JVM. Raised explicitly by the programmer or by the API developer to indicate 
      that a method has been invoked with an invalid argument.
    
    8.]NumberFormatException
       It is the child class of IllegalArgumentException and hence it is an unchecked Exception. 
       It is raised automatically by the JVM. Raised explicitly by the programmer or API developer to 
       indicate that trying to convert String to number type or the String is not properly formatted.
    
    9.]IllegalStateException
       It is the child class of RuntimeException and hence it is an unchecked Exception. 
       It is raised by the programmer or API developer to indicate that a method has been invoked 
       at an inappropriate time.
    
    10.]AssertionError
        It is the child class of RuntimeException and hence it is an unchecked Exception. 
        It is raised by the programmer or API developer to indicate that the assert statement is failed.
        
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONCLUSION : Java Exceptions are great way of handling exceptions. It ensures program integrity in any 
             condition. Programmers should always try to use exceptions as it makes their code more reliable.
