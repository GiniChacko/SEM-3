Q2]

1.We should take care of ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException by not giving in negative 
  values for rows and columns and also by not giving value greater than or equal to 
  size of array.
2.While adding or subtracting matrices we should take care that both matrices should be 
  of the same order. 
3.In multiplication no of columns in first matrix should be equal to no of rows in second matrix,
  for valid multiplication.
